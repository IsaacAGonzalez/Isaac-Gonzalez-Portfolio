# Welcome!
## My name is Isaac Gonzalez. Please check out my portfolio [Here!](https://isaacagonzalez.github.io/Isaac-Gonzalez-Portfolio/)

Here is my portfolio repository hosting the files to my portfolio site which showcases my work and what I've learned so far!
I'll document what I've added and the changes along with some comments in this README.

Mark up website for submittal completed. Created the wireframe and used some placeholder images from the web for now. 
I'll go back and add some more meaningful pictures once there is more content to add.

Navigation links in the header link to sections of the website with the exception of "Resume". Will add resume link when Resume is ready.

Opacity feature on box images works but is affecting child text element. Need to correct so that opacity only affects background image and not child text element.

Contact Me details added. Email address is currently just a place holder. 
Twitter and Spotify link to the Google Twitter account and a fun surprise respectively. 
I'll change this to other interesting links focused on myself once there are more cool links to show about myself.
Github link links to my account as expected.

This is what I have so far.
